# Northstar NPM AMI - SSH Host Key Regeneration
#
# This cloud-init configuration ensures each instance launched from the AMI
# gets unique SSH host keys on first boot.
#
# - ssh_deletekeys: true  -- Deletes existing host keys before regeneration
# - ssh_genkeytypes        -- Specifies which key types to generate
#
# This is the safe way to handle AMI SSH key uniqueness, avoiding the risk
# of bricking SSH by deleting keys without guaranteed regeneration.

ssh_deletekeys: true
ssh_genkeytypes:
  - rsa
  - ecdsa
  - ed25519
